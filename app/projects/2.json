We use the idea of transmedia to promote its  English version  in the US market. The media forms that we are using include Theme song, Trailor, Street Interview, IOS Game app and Facebook (Youtube Channel: Threebody USC; Facebook:Three Body Trilogy). We have 4000 fans on Facebook page and our original theme song MV has generated more than 6000 views on major video websites in China and the US. Now we are negotiating with a Chinese movie company who is interested in using our song in the Three Body movie series."}
