<h1>About Us</h1>
<p class="lead">Authentic Annenberg was created in 2014 by a group of 5 Communication Management Students as part of a group project for CMGT 530: Social Dynamics of Communication Technologies with Professor Doug Thomas. Aiming to answer the simple, yet complex query of “What is communication?” group members Andres Domenech, Carol Zhu, Emma Chen, Jan Zari, and Jiyu Chen along with the help of USC Alum Kamol Treewatchararat set out to create a website that would help to give prospective students, fellow Trojans, and the greater community a better understanding of what can be accomplished as an Annenberg student in one of the many disciplines of communication and journalism available at the Annenberg School.</p>
<p class="lead">The team has been reaching out for content, namely original projects, videos, websites, papers, and presentations from USC Annenberg students from any major or discipline to exhibit on the Authentic Annenberg website. We want to hear from you! If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or would like to share your work with us, please feel free to contact our team at <a href="mailto:authenticannenberg@gmail.com">authenticannenberg@gmail.com</a>. Fight On!</p>
