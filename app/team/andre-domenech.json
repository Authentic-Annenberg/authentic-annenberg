    "bio": "Andres Domenech hails from Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he studied Spanish and Latin American Studies at the University of Michigan.  In a last minute decision, in August of 2013, he picked up his life and drove 2300 miles to attend the University of Southern California, where he is now a first year graduate student in Commmunication Management at Annenberg.  When Andres got here, he had one simple question: “What, exactly is Commmunication?  He found the answer to be quite a diverse and complex one, something that is hard to interpret.  Luckily, he found a group of wonderful people that wanted to know as well, and they came together to make this site!  Andres has formerly worked for Toyota Motors, been a personal trainer and kickboxing instructor, done random bits of stunt work and motion capture, and other random nonsense that doesn’t quite fit into a normal routine, which is pretty much how he likes it.  He’s very curious about the world around him and what it has to offer, and hopes Authentic Annenberg will be one step closer to knowing more and more about the world he lives in.",
