	"bio": "Foodie. Violin player. Loves traveling. Loves cooking. Loves being a member in the Annenberg community! Emma Chen is a second-year Communication Management student at USC Annenberg. After previously working with Pepsi China and Davie Brown Entertainment, she is now a Marketing & Special Event Intern at the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society because she wants to help cure cancer today, not someday. Born and raised in Guangdong, China, Emma is always looking forward to things that are fun and challenging. She started a girlsâ€™ soccer team at the age of 13, organized the first symphony orchestra in her undergraduate university in 2010, worked as the producer to develop a young-generation casino game on Looking Glass last year, and now she is excited to work on the Authentic Annenberg project! For her, Authentic Annenberg is a perfect way to explore who she is as a young Communication professional, and also a way to give back to the Annenberg community.",
