    "bio": "Jan Zari is a first year graduate student in the Master of Communication Management program at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. He is responsible for writing content and conducting external communications for the Authentic Annenberg Team. He graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a Bachelor’s Degree in Political Science in 2009 and has been working for the United States Courts since 2009. He also holds Certificates in Judicial Administration, Paralegal Studies, and Human Resources Management. He chose to pursue the Organizational and Strategic Corporate Communication track in the Communication Management program in order to gain more exposure and education in Human Resources and business management and has also taken an interest in the New Communication Technology courses offered in the CMGT program. He hopes that Annenberg students will be inspired to share their stories through the Authentic Annenberg project and inspire prospective students to do the same. In his spare time, Jan enjoys playing and watching tennis, running 5K’s and half marathons, exploring LA’s diverse food scene, and napping. His favorite superhero is Captain America!",
